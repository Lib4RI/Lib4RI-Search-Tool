
CiteProc download:
	https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php

Files changed:
	- citeproc/vendor/seboettg/citeproc-php/src/CiteProc.php
	- citeproc/vendor/seboettg/citeproc-php/src/Constraint/IsNumeric.php
	The original files still exist as *.bak files.

Installation approach:
	Idea was not to have Citeproc files inside our 'web' (search) installation/directory
	directly and move CiteProc files into a separate/'paralell' directory in order to be
	able to update CiteProc independingly.
	The PHP code still expects to have a 'citeproc' directory inside the 'web' directory',
	but instead of really having this, we will set a symbolic link to the real directory:
	cd /var/www/html/web
	sudo ln -s ../citeproc ./citeproc
